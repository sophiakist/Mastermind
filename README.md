# CPTR 142: Project #2

## Problem Overview

For this project you will convert a program to a different language.

For those that completed CPTR141 in Python:

* You will take a Python project and make it in C++

For those that completed CPTR141 in C++:

* You will take a C++ project and make it in Python

## Solution Specifications

Your solution should strive to meet the standards specified below as they form the basis on which it will be graded.

1. Your program must be divided into functions which perform well-defined and logical sub-tasks for the problem. You may check with your professor or TA about your choice of functions and the parameters and/or return types that they will require.
1. Your program should separate logical function groups into separate files.
    1. Separate the main program from supporting functions.
    1. Create a file that tests your supporting functions, verifying that the functionality is correct.
    1. If using class, save each class in separate files.

    File summary: Your program must contain at least three files:
    * The main program
    * Supporting functions
    * Testing for the supporting functions
1. Your submission should include the program that you were converting.
1. Answer these questions in the `REPORT.md` file.
    * Describe original program.
    * What files are part of the original solutions?
    * What files are part of your converted solutions?
    * What challenges did you have converting your program?
    * What language was better suited for the task? Explain why?

## Code Review

You should have a code review by a tutor before turning in the assignment.
See the Code Review Rubric document for expectations.
I suggest that you schedule your appointment early!
